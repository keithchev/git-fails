    A git repo with a `main` branch and two feature branches, A and B.

    Suppose a commit on A is required to make progress on B,

    Development on both branches then continues, until A is merged to main.

    When B is eventually merged to main, what happens to the commits originally on A

class DivergedCommitHistories(Scenario):
    """
    Suppose there are two remote repos that, initially, have the same commit history.
    One repo resembles a fork of the other, so we call the first repo the 'upstream'
    and the second repo the 'fork', though there is no explicit relationship between the two.

    At some point, the commit histories of the two repos diverge when different developers
    push a series of different commits to each repo.
    However, most or even all of the changes made to the upstream repo are also made to the fork,
    but in a different order and with some additional changes mixed in.

    Later, we want to diff the two repos to see what changes were made to the upstream repo
    that were not made to the fork, and vice versa.
    If the fork includes all of the changes made to the upstream,
    then we expect the diff to be empty and we can say that the fork is up to date
    even though it has a different commit history.

    We also want to understand how git will handle merging the upstream into the fork
    (or vice versa).

    One specific question: suppose a line or file was added in the fork,
    but not in the upstream. If the upstream is merged into the fork,
    will the new line or file be deleted? If not, why not?

    Anecdotally, it is possible for the fork to be up-to-date with the upstream
    but for merge conflicts to still occur when merging the upstream into the fork
    (even though the eventual merge is a no-op).
